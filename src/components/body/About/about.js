            <p>
            My yoga journey began in an effort to find physical wellness as well as balance and self-care in my role as a high school English teacher. Growing up as a dancer, I found that developing a yoga self-practice felt like home; after noticing the personal physical, psychological, and emotional benefits, I knew my role as an educator was shifting to focus on bringing mindfulness and yoga to others. I completed her 95-hour childrenâ€™s yoga teacher training with Mission Propelle and fell in love with the combination of self care and empowerment that yoga offers for children. So, I continued learning and pursued my 200 hour RYT at Tula Yoga Studio in 2019 to share this transformative personal practice with others. Now, I bring yoga to educational settings and studios to cultivate empowerment and mindfulness in yogis of all ages.
