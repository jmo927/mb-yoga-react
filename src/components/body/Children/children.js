            <h1>Yoga for Kids</h1>
            <p>
            My kids and family yoga classes (preK-12) combine the practice of yoga with social emotional learning, literacy skills, and games. The main goal is to empower each yogi to treat their mind, their body, and the people around them with peace, kindness, and respect (and we have lots of fun).
