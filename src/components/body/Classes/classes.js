            <p>
            My adult classes offer a vinyasa style flow with a focus on connecting breath, mind, and body. I aim to strike a balance between effort and ease while fostering a supportive environment that encourages students to discover their own yoga path while developing self-awareness and self-acceptance. 
            </p>

            <p>
            I am currently a sub at Tula Yoga Studio. Stay tuned for upcoming classes!
